# Semester Project: Overview of Covid-19's infodemic 

In this research project, started at the same time as the coronavirus crisis, we are interested in the different impacts of the pandemic on the internet's flow of information. Whether in the medias or on social networks, covid-19 has generated an astronomical amount of information exchange in the world, the analysis of these data could allow us to better understand the reaction of some actors in this infodemic.

This project was carried out in collaboration with the newspaper "letemps.ch" with the aim of writing a series of articles on this infodemia.

## Problematic
As the pandemic spreads around the world and population containment accelerates, social networks and search engines provide a window for people to learn and share about the virus. Mediatization of the pandemic shapes population's reaction to the virus, providing a support to rapidly share good practices about virus prevention but also a support for fake news spreading which could increase population anxiety. In this project we will mainly focus on two subjects, quantifying the information flows about covid-19 and designing a tool to track and vizualise the communities on twitter.


## Workspace 
- `scripts` : scripts used to mine all the data needed in this project 
- `notebooks` : jupyter notebooks used to process and vizualize the data mined
- `data`: contains a small amount of seeds lists used to filter our data mining tools, the datasets mined are stored on a external disk
- `figures`: some of the vizualisations produced in this project
